# fastbase64 (WIP)

FastBase64 is a library which provides CPython bindings to Rust's Base64 library. The provided API is exactly as Python's builtin UUID class.

It is supported on Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, & 3.13.


# Current limitations

For now the library only supports bytes on standard/urlsafe base64 encoding and decoding.
